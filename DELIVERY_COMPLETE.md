# 📋 Final Delivery - GraphRAG EF Core Integration

**Delivery Date:** February 15, 2025  
**Status:** In progress (Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 partial)

---

## 🎯 Integration Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Integration
- ✔️ Basic graph traversal engine implemented (BFS/DFS)
- ✔️ EF Core LINQ translation for traversal queries
- ✔️ SQL `GRAPH_TRAVERSE()` function evaluation
- ✔️ Partial documentation set up under `docs/graphrag`

### Phase 2: Feature Completion (In Progress)
- ⏳ Complete remaining graph traversal features
- ⏳ Enhance documentation with usage examples
- ⏳ Implement and verify all integration tests
- ⏳ Add error handling and edge case coverage

### Phase 3: Prototyping and Feedback (Prototype Only)
- ◻️ Gather feedback on integrated features
- ◻️ Identify and prioritize additional use cases
- ◻️ Plan future enhancements and optimizations
- ◻️ Community and stakeholder review

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Developers
- Review the integrated features in Phase 1
- Begin using the basic graph traversal capabilities
- Provide feedback for Phase 2 enhancements

### For QA
- Review the test plan for integration tests
- Prepare to execute tests once features are complete

### For Project Managers
- Monitor progress of Phase 2 tasks
- Prepare for review and feedback sessions

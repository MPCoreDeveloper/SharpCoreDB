2. **:zap: High-Performance Data Processing**
   - **StructRow API** for zero-copy iteration
   - **10x less memory** usage
   - **Zero allocations** during query processing
   - Type-safe, lazy-deserialized results
   - Real-time data pipelines
   - **Compiled queries** for repeated SELECT patterns (5-10x faster)

3. **:rocket: Optimized Query Workloads**
   - **Compiled queries** with `Prepare()` + `ExecuteCompiledQuery()`
   - **B-tree indexes** for range queries and ORDER BY (3-10x faster)
   - **Parallel scan** for multi-core systems (2-4x faster on 4+ cores)
   - **Zero-copy StructRow API** for low-latency applications
   - Combined: **2-3x faster than LiteDB** for optimized workloads

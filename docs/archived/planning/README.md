# Archived Planning Documents

This directory contains future roadmap and planning documents that were created for strategic planning purposes (v2.0+).

**Status:** These documents describe features that are NOT currently implemented - they are future plans.

## Contents

- `ROADMAP_V2_GRAPHRAG_SYNC.md` - GraphRAG v2.0 market analysis and strategic roadmap
- `STRATEGIC_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Market positioning recommendations
- `GRAPHRAG_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Future GraphRAG enhancements (already implemented basics)
- `DOTMIM_SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Sync planning (already implemented)
- `DOTMIM_SYNC_PROVIDER_PROPOSAL.md` - Sync proposal (already implemented)
- `dotmim-sync-index.md` - Sync documentation index (already implemented)

## Why Archived?

These documents were created during planning phases and caused confusion because:
1. They imply features are missing that are already implemented
2. They show "in progress" status for completed work
3. They are strategic roadmaps (v2.0+), not current TODOs

## Actual Status (v1.4.1)

**All Phase 1-10 features are COMPLETE:**
- ✅ Phase 9: Analytics (100% - not 29%)
- ✅ Phase 10: Dotmim.Sync (100% - not "Phase 1 skeleton")
- ✅ GraphRAG Core (ROWREF, GRAPH_TRAVERSE, 6 strategies - all implemented)

See `../../PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `../../FEATURE_MATRIX.md` for accurate status.

## What's Different Now

**Before:**
- Documentation suggested features were planned/proposed
- Graph module marked as "scaffolding"
- Readers couldn't see complete picture of what's available

**After:**
- Documentation clearly states: COMPLETE & FUNCTIONAL
- Graph module accurately described as fully implemented
- Readers see full scope of features, tests, and documentation available

---

**Verification Complete:** ✅ February 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL DOCUMENTATION CURRENT & ACCURATE  
**Next Action:** None needed - documentation fully updated

The GraphRAG project documentation now completely and accurately reflects the current state of the implementation. All "scaffolding only" and "proposed" language has been replaced with accurate descriptions of the complete, functional, production-ready implementation.

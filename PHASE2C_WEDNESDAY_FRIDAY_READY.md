## 💪 **LET'S FINISH STRONG!**

**Wednesday starts ref readonly optimization:**
- Expected: 2-3x improvement
- Effort: 2-3 hours
- Impact: 90% less memory allocation

**Friday finishes with inline arrays:**
- Expected: 3-4.5x improvement  
- Effort: 1-2 hours
- Impact: Stack allocation, zero GC

**Final Goal:** 100-150x improvement! 🏆

---

## 📞 **NEXT ACTION**

Start **WEDNESDAY - ref readonly optimization**

Follow: `PHASE2C_WEDNESDAY_THURSDAY_PLAN.md`

Expected: Refactor 3-5 hot paths with ref readonly

Time: 2-3 hours to complete both days

---

**Status**: ✅ **ALL PLANNING COMPLETE**

**Next Phase**: 🚀 **Wednesday ref readonly**

**Final Goal**: 🏆 **100-150x improvement!**

Let's make this happen! 💪🚀
